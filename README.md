This Project folder contains the various python scripts and data used to create a GSSHA flood model for Hanalei. This work was for my MS in the earth science department at UH Manoa. The flood model can be found through this figshare link: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Hanalei_Bay_GSSHA_WMS_Software_Files_for_Compound_Flood_Modeling/26073541 .
